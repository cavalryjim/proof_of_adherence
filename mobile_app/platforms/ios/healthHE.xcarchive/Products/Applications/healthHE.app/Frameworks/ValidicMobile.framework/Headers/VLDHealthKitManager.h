/** VLDHealthKitManager is the Validic Mobile interface
 for all HealthKit operations. VLDHealthKitManager is a singleton
 object that must be accessed through the sharedInstance method. Like
 the other components of the Validic Mobile library, VLDHealthKitManager
 requires a valid user session in the VLDSession singleton.
 
 VLDHealthKitManager can upload new records as they come in. Listening
 for new records is done by adding subscriptions for the desired
 sample types. This will automatically prompt the user for permission
 and setup background notifications for new data. 
 
 Background delivery will happen on an hourly basis if new data is available. This
 will result in the data being uploaded in the background throughout the day. 
 For background delivery to be successful you must call observeCurrentSubscriptions
 from your application delegate's application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: callback.
 
 ## Notifications ##
 When VLDHealthKitManager queues records for upload it will send an NSNotification. To listen for this
 notification add an observer to the NSNotificationCenter with the constant ```kVLDHealthKitRecordsProcessedNotification```.
 The userInfo dictionary for this notification will contain two keys, ```recordType``` and ```count```. recordType will contain
 an NSNumber representing the integer value of the VLDRecordType enum and count will contain the number of records that were
 processed.
