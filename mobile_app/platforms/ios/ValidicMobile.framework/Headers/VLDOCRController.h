/** VLDOCRController is the primary interface for getting records from a peripheral
 via OCR. The live results and final record are given to the VLDOCRController's delegate
 object (VLDOCRControllerDelegate).
 
 VLDOCRController is initialized with a VLDOCRPeripheral object. A VLDOCRPeripheral object can
 be obtained by calling [VLDOCRPeripheral supportedPeripherals].
 
 When an instance of VLDOCRController is initialized it will immediately
 turn on the camera for the current device. The camera preview can be accessed
 with the ```previewLayer``` property. VLDOCRController needs to be configured
 with the ```configureForPreviewLayerSize:``` method. You need to call this method
 when VLDOCRController is initialized and pass in the size of the preview layer 
 (generally the full size of the screen). 
 This will allow the library to set the ```overlayFrame``` property to the correct size.
 ```overlayFrame``` should then be used to set the frame of the ```overlayImage``` from
 the peripheral. This is required so that the user is able to position the camera so
 that the peripheral is in the proper place to be processed for OCR. Note: you will need
 to call ```configureForPreviewLayerSize:``` if the size of the preview layer changes, it 
 is recommended to call this method from the ```viewDidLayoutSubviews``` callback in your
 view controller.
